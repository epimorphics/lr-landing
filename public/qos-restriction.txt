request restricted due to resource limitations

Resource limitations may vary from time to time depending on load and other conditions.
You are unlikely to encounter a resource limitation if you use the data API for data accesss
from programs and  issue at most two simultaneous data requests.  Data requests include 
SPARQL queries, data API requests.

Resource limitations for APIs intended to be used by the user interface are more restrictive
than resource limitations on the data API and SPARQL queries.  If you are trying to retrieve
data you are likely better off using the data API or SPARQL rather than scraping the UI pages
or using UI specific APIs.

If the computer issuing the data requests is behind a proxy or is part of a shared serverless
infrastructure, requests from other users behind the same proxy or using the same 
infrastructure may count towards your resource usage.
