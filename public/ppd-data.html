<p>Following feedback from our customers, from February 2014 we will be replacing the two published csv files with one csv file which is in double-delimited format. The new version is available above to ease transition to this new format.
<br/>This will synchronise the publication of the monthly files with the single data file and the year data files. This also allows these files to be generated automatically.</p>
<h2>Single file</h2>
<p>The file below include the transactions received at Land Registry from 1 January 1995 to the most current monthly data. The data is updated monthly and the average size of this file is 2.86 GB.</p>

<table id="ppdcompletedata" class="datatable"></table>
<h2>Yearly files </h2>
<p>The files below include the transactions received at Land Registry in the period from 1 January to 31 December for each year. The data is updated monthly and the sizes of these files range from 87 MB to 222 MB.</p>
