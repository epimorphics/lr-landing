    This website is run by HM Land Registry.  We want as many people as
    possible to be able to use this website.  For example, that means
    you should be able to:

      change colours, contrast levels and fonts
    %li
      zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen
    %li
      navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
    %li
      navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
    %li
      listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

    How accessible this website is

  %p
    We believe that most of this website is compliant with the requirements of
    Web Contents Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA standard. The PPD explorer,
    standard reports builder, and UKHPI should not present any obstacles to
    users with disabilities. If you do find problems accessing these sections,
    please let us know.
  %p
    We know that the SPARQL Qonsole on this website is not fully accessible.
    In particular, we note the following issues:
  %ul.list.list-bullet
    %li
      Background and foreground colours do not have sufficient contrast ratio
      %br
      This fails WCAG 1.4.3 Contrast (Level AA)
      %br
      Compatibility work to be completed by end of calendar year 2020
    %li
      Some input fields do not have associated labels in HTML
      %br
      This fails WCAG 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions (Level A)
      %br

    %li

      This fails WCAG 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value (Level A)
      %br
      Compatibility work to be completed by end of calendar year 2020

    We are working on an update to the SPARQL Qonsole to resolve
    these issues and make the SPARQL Qonsole WCAG 2.1 compliant.
